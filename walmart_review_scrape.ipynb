      "I just wanted something to put in my room  since my kids have completely taken over the family tv and I never got to watch my shows. The screen is large enough with a good display. It's not like those TVs that look realistic, but that's not a big deal to me. I like that I can turn down the brightness or choose a picture mode according to what I'm watching(Movie, sports, animation, etc). There's also a built in stereo boost. I don't like a blaring tv, so I leave it off, but what I heard during set up wasn't bad. It's not surround sound, but it can enhance however you choose (music, speech, bass, etc). The tv was super easy to set up and connect.  The built in Roku is great and connected easily to my Roku account and remotes. It's really lightweight and will look great sitting on a tv stand, dresser, shelf, etc.,  or hanging on the wall. I haven't had any issues and I'm really happy with this purchase. If you just need something to put in the kids room, or watch the news at bedtime, you can't go wrong with this set.\n",

The Roku feature allowed him to download a lot of apps to give him a variety of things for him to watch on his TV my main purpose of me getting him this tv was to get him out of my living room off my new furniture and to get him to spend more time in his room....  :):) :)\n",

      "I recently purchased an Xbox Series S and was in need of an upgrade in order to experience true next gen. My main concern when shopping for new TVs is the possibility of input lag, and I can assure you that this will NOT be a problem. The picture quality is absolutely GORGEOUS, the Roku TV interface itself is buttery smooth and snappy, and the audio is just fine. The overall design and appearance of this TV is very sleek and sexy. My only complaint is that there is a very minuscule cluster of dead pixels in the upper center of the screen. This honestly did not phase me because like I stated earlier, its a VERY small defect and will go unnoticed after taking in that BEAUTIFUL 4K UHD 50 INCH screen. So Im rating this product 5 stars because I LOVE IT, and will continue to purchase and recommend Onn products from Walmart. If youre in search for a great 4K TV on a budget, THIS IS THE ONE.\n",

That was a big mistake because everything was selling out fast. I bought it and added a 3yr warranty for a real good deal. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the sound quality. So I recommend purchasing a sound bar so you can hear better. I'm definitely going to get one. Even with that, I plan on purchasing another one soon.\n",

I love how you can download many other apps to use with this TV I have disney+ YouTube and many others for my kids and the love it because it is a tv that Is very easy to use all you have to do is connect it to your wifi, and open s free roku account and that is all. It is not complicated at all. I really appreciate the huge size, but even though it is so big the screen is also very thin so it pretty much take no space at alm. The screen as you can see in the picture I uploaded is very clear and you can adjust how bright and clear you rang the picture to be, the speakers on the tv are also pretty loud and clear, and for the price you get way more than what you pay for, it just like having your phone on the tv because of all the available apps you can download, I am very happy with this TV and I definitely recommend it!!!\n",

      "Extremely pleased\n",
      "Let me start off by saying that this is my first Roku tv I've ever used and I couldn't be more pleased with it. I've always been curious about Roku TVs and could never gather enough information about them to make a informed decision to purchase one and honestly have realized I wish I hadn't waited so long.  First, the remote is basic and simple to use. There aren't a ton of unnecessary buttons on it so it's easy for kids to use and understand. Batteries are included and the back of the remote slides off. Once you plug it in, you follow the prompts on the screen and is very easy to set up. I used the wireless setting and was able to add my current cable provider. I get lots of channels so I can view shows, movies, kids cartoons/kids movies/shows. You can get local channels and current different news channels. There are some channels that cost money with a subscription. I have it set up so my kids can't order anything (you can set a 4 digit pin) and I'd like to add that I think it's a wonderful feature. Another great thing about this Roku tv is that there are games on there! Some are free and others a one time fee. You can add channels for easy access. This tv has great volume control (volume is on the side of the remote). We keep the volume level at 8 and it's suitable for everyone.  The picture is sharp and clear, colors are vivid. Is it the best on the market? No but there are definitely no complaints about it at all.  This tv can be wall mounted (all hardware is included) or can sit on a stand. The legs on it are extremely sturdy and don't wobble.  I honestly couldn't be more pleased with this tv. I definitely recommend this tv for anyone wanting to cut the cord. There's literally so many channels that everyone in the family can be happy with. You won't be disappointed!\n",

      "I had been thinking about getting a larger TV for our Family Room and when I saw the price on the onn. 50\" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV HDR I decided to buy it. I had read some reviews stating that the sound was not very good on this model. That is not true the sound is great , it has different modes for the sound so I would think that the reviewers most likely had it in the wrong mode to suit their taste. The picture is very sharp and the colors are right on par. The set up was easy to do. I actually had mine mounted to my fireplace. The only thing I did not like is that for the first few days there is a odor of burnt wiring , but I have noticed that most new electronics have that odor for a few days and then it goes away. It came with a one year factory warranty but if you register it by text they make it a two year warranty. If I had known that ahead of time I would not have added the extended warranty. I like this new set and would gladly recommend it.\n",

We would definitely buy another TV from this brand. The picture is really clear. The sound could be a little better, as in higher. I crank it to 30 and it's just about the right amount. Our previous TV only needed to be put on 8 and it was perfect. The sound comes out well but it just takes a lot to get it high enough. We have this in our bedroom but if we had it in the living room we would have our surround sound hooked up or a sound bar.\n",

      "The onn. 50 Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV HDR (100012585) was easy to take out of the box and set up. This is the perfect TV for our family because we only use streaming services and some of those are already apps on the TV. After years of using remote controls with number buttons to change channels, this was an interesting change. Because we now choose what to watch either on a personal hand-held device like a phone or tablet, or on the screen with arrow and OK buttons, the idea of conventional channels is outdated for us. The TV has great color and clarity and I liked how easy it was to find and use the audio and picture adjustment settings. The variety of apps that you can choose to put in your menu is quite extensive and logging in to them using our accounts was easy. Connecting to WIFI was a snap and setup on screen guided the process. The search capabilities are great. It searches across my pay and free TV feeds to give me all of the listings. This is extremely user friendly. The only drawback is that it sits a little low on its legs for my sound bar and the sound bar comes up over the screen a bit. I can easily change this out to wall mount or get a stationery vertical mount for it to accommodate this issue though, but it is worth mentioning and I did not remove a star for it, as it is not something that is actually wrong with the item. Five stars for quality and ease of use.\n",

The WiFi is about 40 feet from the router and down one floor and the tv almost never buffers. Roku loaded tv's are the way to go in my opinion. Throw in a very inexpensive Walmart warranty and it's a no brainer. This is my first ONN branded device and it has given me the confidence in trying their products again in the future.\n",

      "The TV came to my house pretty promptly. I was excited to open it. Not only was I amazed by the packaging but it even included a little screwdriver with the name of the TV on it. I've never seen that before Oh, I went and bought a brand new DVD player from Walmart which I hooked up and everything looks great! I would probably recommend for anybody to get the extended warranty just because you never know with these TVs these days. But I surely hope it lasts a long time! Very pleased for the cost! The plastic is still on and im sure itll look even better with it off!\n",

      "Great Buy!\n",
      "So I recently ordered this Tv when it was on sale for $203. I was a bit skeptical because I'm use to  major name brands and never would've thought the quality just as equal. Shipping made me nervous because I mean, I'm shipping a whole 50 inch state to state but I saw  another review that said they appreciated the packing so that gave me a bit more faith lol. When I got the tv it was in the tv box. Clearly you can see it's a tv so if you're shipping to a home where it may be left on the porch you may want to consider that. But over all when I opened the box there were a lot of precautions taken to make sure the tv got to it's destination without damage so I was extremely happy about that. They picture quality is great! It definitely compares to my LG 55” but at a way cheaper price. The sound os a bit odd. I made adjustments to the sound to fit how I wanted but I noticed when I played Pandora, the sound goes extremely low with music so you may want to consider a sound bar for that reason only but with movies and regular tv streams the sound can be very loud and clear. So even though there were 2 things I wish were improved (the shipping box being more discreet because ppl steal and the sound levels when listening to music need to be improved without needing a sound bar) I gave 5 stars because over all the tv was $203 for a 50 inch, I got free shipping at that time, the tv isn't bad quality at all, and it works perfectly lol so can't complain.\n",

      "Bought this for an outdoor setup (along with an outdoor case), so I didn't want to splurge too much right off the bat.  Got this for $203 and could not be happier with the picture and sound especially at this price.  Bought a smart soundbar to go with it, but returned it because it did not add much over the TV speakers.  Just at volume 34 it was plenty loud and clear in my backyard.  No bass obviously, so will still need something to fill out the sound, but the voice clarity is impressive.  I hope it holds up, because this will be a phenomenal buy at the price.  The plastic is still on the screen in the photos by the way.\n",

      "Great image add decent Roku\n",
      "The TV has a fantastic picture on it which on three of its HDMI ports are capable of full 4k resolution at 60 hz. The fourth port can do 4K resolution but is limited to 30 hz but that doesn't matter as this HDMI port should be used with a soundbar that has an HDMI ARC/CEC connection. My cheap soundbar's ARC refused to work correctly (Grand Teton from Amazon) with the TV but it was an issue with the soundbar itself. The speakers built into the TV are awful like they are on most flat screen televisions. Get a decent soundbar to pair up with the unit. Also this is the only LCD TV that came as a \"dumb\" TV which I was specifically looking for. Rokus that are built into the TV run very slow and are barely usable. Grab a Roku streaming stick   to add to this TV as it's the least expensive Roku model that has the improved dual core processor and can put out a 4k 60 hz signal. If you're buying this TV it's only for the picture itself. Plan on joining a soundbar with HDMI ARC/CEC support so the TV can control its power and volume. Be sure not to get the cheapest one you can find get a decent soundbar with HDMI for $70-$80. Even really pricey televisions need soundbars as the manufacturer is forced to install tiny thin speakers that point downwards. By adding a decent HDMI soundbar you'll get a great picture along with good sound. Don't use the built in speaker on any flat screen television. Even if you're forced to get a flat screen with built in Roku functions still pick up a Roku streaming stick   and use that instead you'll appreciate how much faster Roku runs and it's remote can be programmed to operate this TV just use Sony codes to do it with and also it will be an RF remote which doesn't have to be pointed at anything when you go to operate the Roku system. If you enable the CEC function on the Roku if the TV isn't on its HDMI input press any button on the remote (not power or volume buttons use any of the other ones) This is a $200 flat-screen with a great picture on it spent another $120 to add a decent soundbar and the upgraded Roku stick (they are only $40). For a total of $320 I have a setup that has great video and sound along with a Roku that operates way faster and smoother than one that's built into the TV. My setup rivals brand name \"smart\" flat screens hands down. If you follow my recommendations even if you have to buy a \"smart\" TV you'll have a much better experience than using the built in speakers or Roku. Tech support for this brand were quick to respond to me and made me feel more confident about buying such an inexpensive flat screen. One final thing. The new TV wouldn't fit on my dresser so I found replacement metal legs/feet that bolt into the 200 mm x 200 mm vesa mounting holes which placed the feet much closer together and even allowed 5 degree tilting into the TV. The new legs were only $18 a stand takes up twice as much space and costs ~$35. I guess my total setup cost $340, an affordable price for great picture/sound.\n",

The remote is responsive and the quality is all there for $200. The sceptre logo looks cool too so you at least don't look like you bought your TV from a garage sale lol. I like to save money and sceptre has always been the best price for a premium product. Just started and finished Game of Thrones on this bad Larry and it was quite a vivid, exciting ride.\n",

      "Blown away! Seriously, this was the best purchase I've made in years! We paid $400 for our 55 inch Visio and $200 for Apple TV. This TV has everything you need on it already. It's incredible. Truth about the legs being crappy and not enough for this TV's size. It's wobbly no matter what you do. Definitely getting a universal stand for it. I also used Affirm to finance this purchase and couldn't recommend it more. I'm doing 3 months with $117 a month which my partner and I are splitting. Hands down, totally awesome deal and so thankful it went on sale for $278!!! This is a life upgrade and has made our bedroom a new living room in the re-camp of COVID-19, which we need being around one another non-stop for 10 months! We also bought the 4-year protection plan from All-State for $35!!! Can't say enough great things! Cue the confetti cannon!!!!! Best purchase of 2020!!!\n",

      "I was worried about the TV being damaged during shipping like many other shoppers experienced, but all was well for me. There were two punctures in the box, but no cracks or damage when the TV was powered on.  As for as clarity, it is a great picture for a TV of this price ($348 at the time of purchase). I do have a 65\" Samsung with better color and clarity, but also at a higher price point. I replaced my 55\" TCL Roku TV with this model because I wanted a Tru Motion Display. I don't think any brand has a better user friendly interface than AppleTV or Roku, but LG and Samsung win when it comes to picture quality. I do prefer the LG Smart TV interface over Samsung. But I prefer Samsung's picture quality over LG. I also have an LG soundbar that syncs with my TV so no need to use two remotes or constantly sync the two like with Vizio. Very satisfied with this purchase!\n",

I can't really rate the quality of the tv because I received a damaged tv as well.  Maybe Walmart would be better off cutting ties with FedEx if the quality of their delivery service is below standards.  If the Walmart trucks can deliver to the stores with no problems then FedEx should be able to do the same especially if delivery is their only business.  All I can say is purchase at your own risk and hope and pray you get better results in the end.  If Tik Tok knows the quality of delivery service FedEx provides maybe it's time for a change Walmart.\n",

      "I would give this a 5 star rating but due to delivery I'm deducting 1 star.  I purchased this tv on Nov 30, was given a delivery date of Dec 9.  I was prepared to take off from work to make sure that I was home when it arrived since I've heard so many stories about porch pirates.  To my surprise I receive a text alert from FedEx stating the tv was scheduled for delivery on 12/3.  Don't get me wrong, I do appreciate how quickly the tv arrived after purchase (2 days).  My rating is not on the tv but Walmart.  It just so happened that Thursday was my teleworking day so I was home.  FedEx rings the doorbell at 3pm and drives away.  I pull up my ring app and see the driver carrying the box across my lawn.  By the time I get to the door my 65in tv is leaning against the front door.   What if I wasn't home at that particular time?  Why couldn't Walmart contact me to give me a new delivery date?\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, on to the tv.  I've read a lot of reviews from customers stating that their tv was damaged when it arrived so I was mentally prepared for the disappointment.  Once the tv arrived I brought the box in the house and took pictures of the box, no issues.  I then carefully unboxed the tv and found no issues.  I read where the tv looked fine until it was turned on and then there were cracked screens, no issues.  I am totally satisfied with my purchase.  I'm just bothered by the lack of communication by Walmart not telling me of the earlier delivery date.  I'm left thinking what COULD have happened if I wasn't home.\n",

      "I have been purchasing JVC products for decades.  Much of their product line is outsourced now and their latest LCD televisions are actually made by Shenzhen Mtc of China.  The box was delivered heavily damaged but when I removed the TV, everything looked intact.  The low quality construction however was very apparent.  The plastic used is extremely thin and flimsy and everything from the power cord connection to the connectors for the HDMI cables is low quality.  Even the power switch looked like an afterthought that was attached to the bottom, left corner of the set.  There are otherwise no volume or input buttons and you have to rely on the remote for all of those functions.  Unfortunately when I plugged in the TV, it was apparent that the set had been heavily damaged.  The screen illuminated and appeared to be cracked internally.  Fortunately I was able to bring the TV to my local WalMart and have the refund processed within minutes.  I would be very hesitant to consider another JVC TV manufactured by Shenzhen.  Their previous contractor, AmTran of Taiwan made some high quality, outstanding televisions.\n",

      "The colors out of the box aren't great but thats to be expected and can be fixed with the photos included so you don't have to spend hours to make it look perfect also I could only add 2 photos so turn off everything in picture options and leave black level on auto and change the aspect ratio setting to original other that the tv is fantastic highly recommend\n",

      "Blown away! Seriously, this was the best purchase I've made in years! We paid $400 for our 55 inch Visio and $200 for Apple TV. This TV has everything you need on it already. It's incredible. Truth about the legs being crappy and not enough for this TV's size. It's wobbly no matter what you do. Definitely getting a universal stand for it. I also used Affirm to finance this purchase and couldn't recommend it more. I'm doing 3 months with $117 a month which my partner and I are splitting. Hands down, totally awesome deal and so thankful it went on sale for $278!!! This is a life upgrade and has made our bedroom a new living room in the re-camp of COVID-19, which we need being around one another non-stop for 10 months! We also bought the 4-year protection plan from All-State for $35!!! Can't say enough great things! Cue the confetti cannon!!!!! Best purchase of 2020!!!\n",

      "Better than TCL and Vizio!\n",
      "I was worried about the TV being damaged during shipping like many other shoppers experienced, but all was well for me. There were two punctures in the box, but no cracks or damage when the TV was powered on.  As for as clarity, it is a great picture for a TV of this price ($348 at the time of purchase). I do have a 65\" Samsung with better color and clarity, but also at a higher price point. I replaced my 55\" TCL Roku TV with this model because I wanted a Tru Motion Display. I don't think any brand has a better user friendly interface than AppleTV or Roku, but LG and Samsung win when it comes to picture quality. I do prefer the LG Smart TV interface over Samsung. But I prefer Samsung's picture quality over LG. I also have an LG soundbar that syncs with my TV so no need to use two remotes or constantly sync the two like with Vizio. Very satisfied with this purchase!\n",

I can't really rate the quality of the tv because I received a damaged tv as well.  Maybe Walmart would be better off cutting ties with FedEx if the quality of their delivery service is below standards.  If the Walmart trucks can deliver to the stores with no problems then FedEx should be able to do the same especially if delivery is their only business.  All I can say is purchase at your own risk and hope and pray you get better results in the end.  If Tik Tok knows the quality of delivery service FedEx provides maybe it's time for a change Walmart.\n",

The screen resolution is amazing, the sound is strong but not perfect, could be better, even with all those voice options. It is very easy to carry and light weight. The menu option is a bit complicated, could be better. This tv is very smart especially that you get all the advanced smart th options for this price tag and also you can control it with the LG ThinQ app. I got a mount to hang it on the wall.\n",

Opened it and the screen was clearly cracked. So I returned it and ordered another one of the same tv. Second delivery box was slightly damaged. I didn't notice it was broken until I had it out of the box.  Needless to say the return process was very easy.\n",

      "I would give this a 5 star rating but due to delivery I'm deducting 1 star.  I purchased this tv on Nov 30, was given a delivery date of Dec 9.  I was prepared to take off from work to make sure that I was home when it arrived since I've heard so many stories about porch pirates.  To my surprise I receive a text alert from FedEx stating the tv was scheduled for delivery on 12/3.  Don't get me wrong, I do appreciate how quickly the tv arrived after purchase (2 days).  My rating is not on the tv but Walmart.  It just so happened that Thursday was my teleworking day so I was home.  FedEx rings the doorbell at 3pm and drives away.  I pull up my ring app and see the driver carrying the box across my lawn.  By the time I get to the door my 65in tv is leaning against the front door.   What if I wasn't home at that particular time?  Why couldn't Walmart contact me to give me a new delivery date?\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, on to the tv.  I've read a lot of reviews from customers stating that their tv was damaged when it arrived so I was mentally prepared for the disappointment.  Once the tv arrived I brought the box in the house and took pictures of the box, no issues.  I then carefully unboxed the tv and found no issues.  I read where the tv looked fine until it was turned on and then there were cracked screens, no issues.  I am totally satisfied with my purchase.  I'm just bothered by the lack of communication by Walmart not telling me of the earlier delivery date.  I'm left thinking what COULD have happened if I wasn't home.\n",

      "This tv only lasted us 6 months and we don't  even watch a ton of tv!!! The tv has vertical lines through it and it has been mounted on the wall and never touched since the day we got it. Walmart is a joke when it comes to helping make things right with the poor quality of material they sell. I now have to go through RCA to see if they will do anything about it. This poor quality is completely unacceptable.\n",

      "I have only had this TV for 12 hours.  The sound is good, but I wanted better. I have a Logitech Z313 audio system with great bass. It uses a 3.5 jack that I usually hook up to the headphone jack, but this TV does not have one, so I tried to use a RCA AV OUTPUT, but this TV only has a AV INPUT! It has a DIGITAL OPTICAL CABLE CONNECTION, that will work great with a sound bar. There is a little hole next to the HDMI cable that is for EXTERNAL AMPLIFIERS, so I put my 3.5mm jack in there and it works great. When this is connected you are unable to use the internal speakers. I have watched 3 4k videos with absolutely no problem at all. It streams videos very well. No buffering or nothing when using KODI!! This is a fantastic deal for 319.99. This is as good as any Black Friday deal you are going to find 4 months from now.  I would recommend this TV to all my friends and family and anyone who ask. The quality of the picture and 4k movies are TOTALLY AWESOME!! BUY IT BEFORE THE PRICE GOES UP!!! As always, buy the 4 year warranty to be on the safe side!! The 52.00 is not a big loss if you don't use it, but if you need it, you will be very happy you have it!!\n",

      "This Roku TV is an overall great TV, and well worth the price.The picture quality is crystal-clear if you use streaming, or anything with an HDMI connection. Things like a non-HDMI cable/satellite box, or a VCR will not produce a high quality picture, but they're never expected to, especially on HDTVs.The streaming is smooth and seamless. Videos load within about three seconds, with no buffering or random disconnecting.The speakers are decent, especially for such a thin TV. I only have to adjust the volume ±10 between external devices and streaming. The only noteworthy exception is Netflix; the volume does have to be turned up high in order to hear it well, but about 50-70 will sound loud and clear in my case. I've never had to get it up to 100, and I almost never have to get it beyond 20.The wide variety of connection ports this TV supports will work great with almost every entertainment center, as they support both HD and SD devices, and even a USB flash drive.All in all, this is a quality TV, and a steal for the price. I highly recommend it.\n",

      "I now have two of these TVs and I really do think it works very. I had no trouble setting it up by myself except for the fact that the legs on one of the TVs is not fitting correctly. my issue with the TV is the fact that you must buy a Roku soundbar to go with this TV. I bought salad bars to go with this TV at the time of purchase and come to find out that I had to get a Roku Soundbar it could be no other brand. I even had a smaller Soundbar for the bedroom TV but it was and on soundbar not a Roku. the TV itself works well and the speakers you can hear pretty well. I am hard of hearing so I needed the speakers to go with the TV so I didn't blow the TV speakers.\n",

      "Is been awhile since we have bought a new TV-still have 3 box TVs that still work fine they just are heavy and take up a lot of space. So we are upgrading. Like the slim, lightweight deign which sits nicely on the wall mount. Hooking up was another story. Maybe because we are not on top of the newest technology or something, we had a difficult time getting it going. We have satellite tv and needed to connect the box which does not support HDMI so we searched U Tube and finally with some hit and miss views we figured it out somehow. Works great, clear, crisp picture and sound works fine for us. Now have to take time to figure the Roku out and secure a better internet service. Almost returned the tv due to all the frustration although walked away from the set up came back with more connection ideas adorned with patience and zap it connected. Thanks to U Tube and Phillips support we are enjoying!\n",

The resolution is 720 which is more than capable of playing any streaming service in great quality, I honestly don't see any lack of resolution. The sound is decent, better than a lot of other Roku TVs for the price range, the volume diminishing return is not as bad as it is with other brands. The only gripe I have is the Vudu button which it's useless to me.\n",

The picture is clear and the sound quality is perfect for me, even without a sound bar.  I thought it was a good price on sale for a SMART Roku TV---less than $160.00 and a name brand---Philips.

The screen is large enough with a good display. It's not like those TVs that look realistic, but that's not a big deal to me. I like that I can turn down the brightness or choose a picture mode according to what I'm watching(Movie, sports, animation, etc). There's also a built in stereo boost. I don't like a blaring tv, so I leave it off, but what I heard during set up wasn't bad. It's not surround sound, but it can enhance however you choose (music, speech, bass, etc). The tv was super easy to set up and connect.  The built in Roku is great and connected easily to my Roku account and remotes. It's really lightweight and will look great sitting on a tv stand, dresser, shelf, etc.,  or hanging on the wall. I haven't had any issues and I'm really happy with this purchase. If you just need something to put in the kids room, or watch the news at bedtime, you can't go wrong with this set.\", \"I like all the features and the size of course and  I just need to get a sound bar for better audio and speaker out put . Otherwise I'm a highly satisfied customer.\", 'Great tv. Once I selected “theater sound” the clouds parted and there was entertainment bliss—ok, maybe that a bit extra, however, the sound did vastly improved. Perfect size for me. Easy setup and operation.', 'Love how clear the picture is, light weight I was able to put it up by myself, very satisfied with my purchase....', 'Great price! I bought mine on sale for $179. Picture quality is great, even at factory settings! Exceptional sound. I never have to play tv louder than 50 on volume. Easy set up and remote even controls volume on tv. Very satisfied', 'It was so easy to setup. It works very well without cable . It has a lot of channels to watch.', 'This is my 2nd only because my boiz bought it for me for Christmas, the 1st 1 we had the  screen went black. this is not a good TV I wish they could get their money back.', 'Its very slow. Ive had it for a week and when I press any button theres always like a 5second delay. Sometimes ill have to repeatedly press a button for it to respond. Ill be returning it today.', 'I bought this TV for my daughter 4 months ago, and all of a sudden, there was a line down the middle of it when she turned it on. It has never fallen, been dropped, hit or anything.

It is hands-down the best TV I've ever had the brand is great the sound is great the picture is so clear.\", 'Loo good', 'It is the best tv I have ever purchased.

The Roku feature allowed him to download a lot of apps to give him a variety of things for him to watch on his TV my main purpose of me getting him this tv was to get him out of my living room off my new furniture and to get him to spend more time in his room....  :):) :)\", 'I recently purchased an Xbox Series S and was in need of an upgrade in order to experience true next gen. My main concern when shopping for new TVs is the possibility of input lag, and I can assure you that this will NOT be a problem. The picture quality is absolutely GORGEOUS, the Roku TV interface itself is buttery smooth and snappy, and the audio is just fine. The overall design and appearance of this TV is very sleek and sexy. My only complaint is that there is a very minuscule cluster of dead pixels in the upper center of the screen. This honestly did not phase me because like I stated earlier, its a VERY small defect and will go unnoticed after taking in that BEAUTIFUL 4K UHD 50 INCH screen. So Im rating this product 5 stars because I LOVE IT, and will continue to purchase and recommend Onn products from Walmart. If youre in search for a great 4K TV on a budget, THIS IS THE ONE.', \"Extremely pleased! We got this for our den. Wall mounted, easy hookup, works great. I have other ROKU tv's and am very happy. This ONN 50 has great color.\", 'This was the tv I ordered for my moms birthday I wanted it in two days but it came late . It kept changing dates when it would arrive. I started to get irritated. The only thing I hate was the wait but it tv is beautiful. Thank you so much Walmart', \"I love my tv. I had a 47” Vizio (which is awesome too) that finally stopped working. I kept saying I was going to replace it and waited until December to do so. That was a big mistake because everything was selling out fast. I bought it and added a 3yr warranty for a real good deal. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the sound quality. So I recommend purchasing a sound bar so you can hear better. I'm definitely going to get one. Even with that, I plan on purchasing another one soon.\", \"I bought this tv in early May of 2020. It was working perfectly fine. Now all of a sudden the screen turns to a green color no matter what I'm trying to watch, or even when I'm trying to play a video game or watch a dvd. I give it three stars because I don't think that it's not the best quality tv.\", \"Pretty good tv. Though I was annoyed that it would disconnect from the internet once in awhile. Not a deal breaker. The big problem was that just over 6 months of using it a red vertical line appeared right in the middle of the tv. When on line with support I noticed a small horizontal yellow line cutting through the red line. I filled a claim. Idk if they are using the warranty or protection plan, since they are out of my model of TV they are sending me a refund. I'll be going with a new brand of TV\", \"I have this tv for 4 months I didn't watch tv that much last week I go sit in living room with company turn on tv and the had a black screen I try several times turning on and off call customer support for onn they sent me instructions I tried return to Walmart they refused to give me a new one so here with a tv that don't work and no tv\", \"Don't fall for it...\\nI have now purchased 2 of these, as the first one came with a portion of the screen that has a backwards C of pixels that arent working. \\nToday I recieved my second tv, this one has a W in the exact same spot. \\nI think Walmart is hoping you don't open the box til its too late to return. \\nI opened mine immediately. So they will both be returned. \\nDon't waste your time or money.\", 'I ordered the tv for my daughter for Christmas and didnt open it and set it up until maybe Feb 1st and lord and behold it has defects... the screen goes in and out looked like missing pieces of the screen. I now see that Im outside the window of returning it and Im highly upset. Im upset because Im not sure why it does this not sure if they dropped it during delivery or what but its definitely a defect.', 'I love this onn 50 in tv it is Awesome!!! I love how you can download many other apps to use with this TV I have disney+ YouTube and many others for my kids and the love it because it is a tv that Is very easy to use all you have to do is connect it to your wifi, and open s free roku account and that is all. It is not complicated at all. I really appreciate the huge size, but even though it is so big the screen is also very thin so it pretty much take no space at alm. The screen as you can see in the picture I uploaded is very clear and you can adjust how bright and clear you rang the picture to be, the speakers on the tv are also pretty loud and clear, and for the price you get way more than what you pay for, it just like having your phone on the tv because of all the available apps you can download, I am very happy with this TV and I definitely recommend it!!!', \"Let me start off by saying that this is my first Roku tv I've ever used and I couldn't be more pleased with it. I've always been curious about Roku TVs and could never gather enough information about them to make a informed decision to purchase one and honestly have realized I wish I hadn't waited so long.  First, the remote is basic and simple to use. There aren't a ton of unnecessary buttons on it so it's easy for kids to use and understand. Batteries are included and the back of the remote slides off. Once you plug it in, you follow the prompts on the screen and is very easy to set up. I used the wireless setting and was able to add my current cable provider. I get lots of channels so I can view shows, movies, kids cartoons/kids movies/shows. You can get local channels and current different news channels. There are some channels that cost money with a subscription. I have it set up so my kids can't order anything (you can set a 4 digit pin) and I'd like to add that I think it's a wonderful feature. Another great thing about this Roku tv is that there are games on there! Some are free and others a one time fee. You can add channels for easy access. This tv has great volume control (volume is on the side of the remote). We keep the volume level at 8 and it's suitable for everyone.  The picture is sharp and clear, colors are vivid. Is it the best on the market? No but there are definitely no complaints about it at all.  This tv can be wall mounted (all hardware is included) or can sit on a stand. The legs on it are extremely sturdy and don't wobble.  I honestly couldn't be more pleased with this tv. I definitely recommend this tv for anyone wanting to cut the cord. There's literally so many channels that everyone in the family can be happy with. You won't be disappointed!\", 'I had been thinking about getting a larger TV for our Family Room and when I saw the price on the onn. 50\" Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV HDR I decided to buy it. I had read some reviews stating that the sound was not very good on this model. That is not true the sound is great , it has different modes for the sound so I would think that the reviewers most likely had it in the wrong mode to suit their taste. The picture is very sharp and the colors are right on par. The set up was easy to do. I actually had mine mounted to my fireplace. The only thing I did not like is that for the first few days there is a odor of burnt wiring , but I have noticed that most new electronics have that odor for a few days and then it goes away. It came with a one year factory warranty but if you register it by text they make it a two year warranty. If I had known that ahead of time I would not have added the extended warranty. I like this new set and would gladly recommend it.', 'We just love this TV. The picture and sound are clear and the size is large, but not overwhelming. Perfect for our master bedroom. What we like most is the easy access to all our streaming services with the built in Roku. We cut the cable cord a while back and we are able to stream from all of our services right from the main screen. Easy to use, easy to setup, sleek and functional. This tv is perfect for all our needs.', \"This an amazing TV especially for being an off brand. We usually only buy Samsung but this is pretty awesome! The Roku features are terrific and so easy to use. We would definitely buy another TV from this brand. The picture is really clear. The sound could be a little better, as in higher. I crank it to 30 and it's just about the right amount. Our previous TV only needed to be put on 8 and it was perfect. The sound comes out well but it just takes a lot to get it high enough. We have this in our bedroom but if we had it in the living room we would have our surround sound hooked up or a sound bar.\", 'The onn. 50 Class 4K UHD LED Roku Smart TV HDR (100012585) was easy to take out of the box and set up. This is the perfect TV for our family because we only use streaming services and some of those are already apps on the TV. After years of using remote controls with number buttons to change channels, this was an interesting change. Because we now choose what to watch either on a personal hand-held device like a phone or tablet, or on the screen with arrow and OK buttons, the idea of conventional channels is outdated for us. The TV has great color and clarity and I liked how easy it was to find and use the audio and picture adjustment settings. The variety of apps that you can choose to put in your menu is quite extensive and logging in to them using our accounts was easy. Connecting to WIFI was a snap and setup on screen guided the process. The search capabilities are great. It searches across my pay and free TV feeds to give me all of the listings. This is extremely user friendly. The only drawback is that it sits a little low on its legs for my sound bar and the sound bar comes up over the screen a bit. I can easily change this out to wall mount or get a stationery vertical mount for it to accommodate this issue though, but it is worth mentioning and I did not remove a star for it, as it is not something that is actually wrong with the item. Five stars for quality and ease of use.', \"Love this tv and at such an affordable price ($210)  picture is awesome. Have not tried any 4K content so I can't give an opinion on that. The WiFi is about 40 feet from the router and down one floor and the tv almost never buffers. Roku loaded tv's are the way to go in my opinion. Throw in a very inexpensive Walmart warranty and it's a no brainer. This is my first ONN branded device and it has given me the confidence in trying their products again in the future.\", 'I was a little skeptic to buy this brand because over never had it before but I love it!! I bought it as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. Everything works good and it was easy to set up!! Would definitely order again', 'Had this TV for approximately 2 months, turned it on 10 times and the picture went out!  And, of course, did not purchase extra warranty so out of pocket the money and no TV.', 'Wonderful television for the price, excellent sound and volume, like it better than my one tv.\\nHighly recommend it, thank you Walmart for the Black Friday Sale.', 'I have to give this a 5 Star,! Because, this is the most beautiful, Huge tv. The color is lovely, to me. I must say I feel Special to have this tv. Feel like I made an accomplishment in life. I have been through a lot with my health. This was my  gift to myself! Money well spent!!!! Please buy you will NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! Thanking God for another year through all this Uncertainties and for giving me  Is Good!', \"The TV came to my house pretty promptly. I was excited to open it. Not only was I amazed by the packaging but it even included a little screwdriver with the name of the TV on it. I've never seen that before Oh, I went and bought a brand new DVD player from Walmart which I hooked up and everything looks great! I would probably recommend for anybody to get the extended warranty just because you never know with these TVs these days. But I surely hope it lasts a long time! Very pleased for the cost! The plastic is still on and im sure itll look even better with it off!\", 'So far I like the TV, the size is awesome, has good volume sound, great picture quality, warranty inexpensive, awesome price, this is a fantastic product to me. As important, all its features are actually implemented well. Good picture, light weight, good value for the price, inexpensive to me.', \"So I recently ordered this Tv when it was on sale for $203. I was a bit skeptical because I'm use to  major name brands and never would've thought the quality just as equal. Shipping made me nervous because I mean, I'm shipping a whole 50 inch state to state but I saw  another review that said they appreciated the packing so that gave me a bit more faith lol. When I got the tv it was in the tv box. Clearly you can see it's a tv so if you're shipping to a home where it may be left on the porch you may want to consider that. But over all when I opened the box there were a lot of precautions taken to make sure the tv got to it's destination without damage so I was extremely happy about that. They picture quality is great! It definitely compares to my LG 55” but at a way cheaper price. The sound os a bit odd. I made adjustments to the sound to fit how I wanted but I noticed when I played Pandora, the sound goes extremely low with music so you may want to consider a sound bar for that reason only but with movies and regular tv streams the sound can be very loud and clear. So even though there were 2 things I wish were improved (the shipping box being more discreet because ppl steal and the sound levels when listening to music need to be improved without needing a sound bar) I gave 5 stars because over all the tv was $203 for a 50 inch, I got free shipping at that time, the tv isn't bad quality at all, and it works perfectly lol so can't complain.\", \"Bought this for an outdoor setup (along with an outdoor case), so I didn't want to splurge too much right off the bat.  Got this for $203 and could not be happier with the picture and sound especially at this price.  Bought a smart soundbar to go with it, but returned it because it did not add much over the TV speakers.  Just at volume 34 it was plenty loud and clear in my backyard.  No bass obviously, so will still need something to fill out the sound, but the voice clarity is impressive.  I hope it holds up, because this will be a phenomenal buy at the price.  The plastic is still on the screen in the photos by the way.\", \"This is the second one of these TVs i have purchaed! Great size and clear picture i'm very easy to install. Please note, that it is not a smart television, but at this price it's an amazing deal and easily made smart with an Amazon fire stick or Ruco.  Would highly recommend\", 'I actually thought it was a smart TVs, however after I set it up I decided it was just fine for the price and. A plus was that its definition is fantastic as I have visual issues and it Id perfect for me .', 'The TV has a fantastic picture on it which on three of its HDMI ports are capable of full 4k resolution at 60 hz. The fourth port can do 4K resolution but is limited to 30 hz but that doesn\\'t matter as this HDMI port should be used with a soundbar that has an HDMI ARC/CEC connection. My cheap soundbar\\'s ARC refused to work correctly (Grand Teton from Amazon) with the TV but it was an issue with the soundbar itself. The speakers built into the TV are awful like they are on most flat screen televisions. Get a decent soundbar to pair up with the unit. Also this is the only LCD TV that came as a \"dumb\" TV which I was specifically looking for. Rokus that are built into the TV run very slow and are barely usable. Grab a Roku streaming stick   to add to this TV as it\\'s the least expensive Roku model that has the improved dual core processor and can put out a 4k 60 hz signal. If you\\'re buying this TV it\\'s only for the picture itself. Plan on joining a soundbar with HDMI ARC/CEC support so the TV can control its power and volume. Be sure not to get the cheapest one you can find get a decent soundbar with HDMI for $70-$80. Even really pricey televisions need soundbars as the manufacturer is forced to install tiny thin speakers that point downwards. By adding a decent HDMI soundbar you\\'ll get a great picture along with good sound. Don\\'t use the built in speaker on any flat screen television. Even if you\\'re forced to get a flat screen with built in Roku functions still pick up a Roku streaming stick   and use that instead you\\'ll appreciate how much faster Roku runs and it\\'s remote can be programmed to operate this TV just use Sony codes to do it with and also it will be an RF remote which doesn\\'t have to be pointed at anything when you go to operate the Roku system. If you enable the CEC function on the Roku if the TV isn\\'t on its HDMI input press any button on the remote (not power or volume buttons use any of the other ones) This is a $200 flat-screen with a great picture on it spent another $120 to add a decent soundbar and the upgraded Roku stick (they are only $40). For a total of $320 I have a setup that has great video and sound along with a Roku that operates way faster and smoother than one that\\'s built into the TV. My setup rivals brand name \"smart\" flat screens hands down. If you follow my recommendations even if you have to buy a \"smart\" TV you\\'ll have a much better experience than using the built in speakers or Roku. Tech support for this brand were quick to respond to me and made me feel more confident about buying such an inexpensive flat screen. One final thing. The new TV wouldn\\'t fit on my dresser so I found replacement metal legs/feet that bolt into the 200 mm x 200 mm vesa mounting holes which placed the feet much closer together and even allowed 5 degree tilting into the TV. The new legs were only $18 a stand takes up twice as much space and costs ~$35. I guess my total setup cost $340, an affordable price for great picture/sound.', 'Im preparing for the ps5 and wanting a 4K tv seeing as how the price was so low for its size I say its flaws are manageable picture ok not great screen very easy to install and view audio has 0 bass hook to any external device and your set (HIGHLY RECOMMEND)', \"I purchased this TV while I was in the process of refurnishing my home (so I didn't open it immediately) The delivery driver placed the TV inside my home, and it has been in the same place since it was delivered. Physically looking at the TV there doesn't appear to be any damage, but as soon as I powered it on to set it up I was able to see that the screen is cracked.\", \"My first fall screen was a sceptre. Then my 40 inch. Now my beautiful 50 inch baby is all mine and it looks terrific. The stock speakers were even pretty decent. Picture quality is great. The remote is responsive and the quality is all there for $200. The sceptre logo looks cool too so you at least don't look like you bought your TV from a garage sale lol. I like to save money and sceptre has always been the best price for a premium product. Just started and finished Game of Thrones on this bad Larry and it was quite a vivid, exciting ride.\", \"I was very pleased with my purchase. The TV has a great picture and the price was great.  The only down side is the audio quality isn't the best.  It is acceptable though.  I would definitely buy another one.  This is a great buy for someone who wants a bigger better tv but doesn't have a lot to spend in one.  I don't feel they will be disappointed at all.\", \"I love this 4K TV. The sound is perfect and the picture is sharp. The only thing is that my xbox one s doesn't allow HDR10 on this 4k TV which is it's fine. And people say the sound is very poor on this TV and no it's not. I am play Resident Evil 2 Remake as Leon and the sound is very good and clear. The screen is also perfect for our den room to play our games. We had a 40 inch 4K smart TV and the screen was not very big so we put that TV in the guest room.\", '50 inch tv for $200.00!! Had to buy it. Way better than I expected for the price being so cheap. Great picture. Sound could be a bit better but I have it hooked up to my Vizio surround with the speakers off so no big deal. Love it.', 'This tv is the perfect size for my entertainment center. The volume is great. It get very loud and this is coming from someone with hearing issues. Also being able to adjust the picture ratio is a definite plus. Good value at a reasonable price.', 'Was looking for a great deal for the money and for my patio. The images are high definition. I run it with my Fire Stick and I love it. No cable or satellite fees.', 'Got the tv, unwrapped it, set it all up, turned it on, and there was a big line on the screen. I should have learned from the other reviews not to buy a tv online and have it shipped.', \"Let's just start with I don't ever write reviews but I had to for this tv it's lovely nice sound great picture and for $189. Best bang for your buck I ordered another one a 55in which should be here in a few days if your going back and forth about getting it just get it you won't regret it looks even nicer on the wall too I get lots of compliments on\", 'I didnt want to give this product one star since it may have worked perfectly had it arrived in tact. However it is worth noting that if you buy this item online there is a definite possibility of it arriving damaged.  There was a small amount of damage on the box, but not enough that I would have suspected the tv to be damaged. It comes shipped in its own packaging, there is not a larger box that the tv box is placed into.  The price was right and I imagine if it had actually made it on my wall in tact it probably would have gotten a 4-5 rating.', \"Price and picture are great! Not a smart Tv, but I have chromecast.

Cant believe how much I saved on it and the best part is the airplay feature, just wished you could mirror your phone and not just broadcast videos, now that would have been the. cherry on top. However, didn,t make me like it any less. Great product and such nice quality.', \"The sharpness and color is the best I've ever had. I also like the small frame.  All you see is the screen, not a big frame around the TV that just takes up space. Also, it has an Apple TV app built into it, so I no longer have to use my Apple TV box.  I'm very happy with it.\", \"This product is great. However, when I received the product, somehow oil was on and inside the box. I immediately thought my purchase was damaged. After further investigation it, fortunately was not. However, the delivery company needs to be more aware of what's happening to the packages they are carrying.\", \"First setup was a breeze with this TV! It only took a few minutes after connection to my network was made and walked you thru all the options. I only wished it explained or guided you thru calibration. \\n\\nThe sharpness and color really pop in 4K and the HDR setting enhance this further. Overall I think the blacks and contrast accuracy are superb for a TV this affordable. I didn't test tye sound as I hae a sound bar but feel with the ARCe connection it enhanced its quality further compared to my last TV. \\n\\nApps and included features are customizable but sometimes bloated (never use) but I mostly use my connected Firestick anyway. Overall from these features I have to give this TV 5 stars because of its value and would consider a larger upgraded version in the future.\", \"Box was open when we got it, box had some hole pokes.\\n\\nTv seems ok, thankfully!\\n\\nI'm not sure if I'm just not used to the 4k picture or we need a 4k HDMI cord.\\n\\nI don't like that when the WiFi acts up the Tv, even when watching a movie on our TiVo, goes blank and I have to switch the input off Cable box and back again.\", \"This is the second of these we've ordered with the exact same problem. Same TV.. same problem. We sent the first one back and had to wait on this one to arrive. Now it has almost the identical issue as the first one did. Very unhappy. Apparently this is a quality control factory issue with Vizio and they have no clue. But we are truly upset. \\nProblem is...omg..I dont want to have to ship yet ANOTHER TV back in the mail. I have to pack it back up, print a label, drive it to the post office, and carry in this hugely heavy box. \\nSo to the problem. It has a warp on the right side of the screen toward the center. The first one actually had the mold of the TV in that spot warped AND the LCD screen warped slightly. With this one the frame is absolutely perfect but after we got it completely set up, all of the HDMI cables plugged in, cords hooked up, surround sound hooked up, only then did I realize that in the same spot when you turned it on there was a slight warp internally in the picture of the LCD screen. Right in that same spot. \\nNow the only saving grace is you can only see it when the picture is showing something completely dark and you are sitting off to the side of the TV. If you are sitting directly in front of the TV you cannot see it at all. I just cannot decide if I want to return a second television because ImIf you are sitting directly in front of the TV you cannot see it at all. I just cannot decide if I want to return a second television because Im so frustrated.\", \"I got kinda disappointed. When it's dark screen or no signal screen I see kinda clouds in the corners and center of tv. \\nI thought maybe it's defect. And ordered another TV.

And old TV doesn't has this issue.\", \"I didn't  expect much for a tv of this price but I was totally let down.So I'm not sure if I just got a bad one but there are huge dark Mark's all over the tv. It's only noticeable when it's a solid color. You can see it at any angle but the effect is minimized when looking directly head on but the second you move an inch in either direction they become super pronounced. Its noticeable and very distracting during normal viewing. I'm going to return as soon as possible. I believe I'm going to go with an m7. I've heard these are a black friday model made with the panels that dont pass QC for the normal retail models. I thought that couldnt be true but after receiving it, I now believe that is possible. Really sad with this purchase. I would not recommend.\", \"This vizio 55 inch tv looked great at first. Easy to set up and connect. One quarter of the left side of screen was damaged. You couldn't see until you turned it on. Had to return thru USPS not Walmart. Walmarts policy not mine.

Best purchase of 2020!!!\", 'I was worried about the TV being damaged during shipping like many other shoppers experienced, but all was well for me. There were two punctures in the box, but no cracks or damage when the TV was powered on.  As for as clarity, it is a great picture for a TV of this price ($348 at the time of purchase). I do have a 65\" Samsung with better color and clarity, but also at a higher price point. I replaced my 55\" TCL Roku TV with this model because I wanted a Tru Motion Display. I don\\'t think any brand has a better user friendly interface than AppleTV or Roku, but LG and Samsung win when it comes to picture quality. I do prefer the LG Smart TV interface over Samsung.

I can't really rate the quality of the tv because I received a damaged tv as well.  Maybe Walmart would be better off cutting ties with FedEx if the quality of their delivery service is below standards.  If the Walmart trucks can deliver to the stores with no problems then FedEx should be able to do the same especially if delivery is their only business.

To my surprise I receive a text alert from FedEx stating the tv was scheduled for delivery on 12/3.  Don't get me wrong, I do appreciate how quickly the tv arrived after purchase (2 days).  My rating is not on the tv but Walmart.  It just so happened that Thursday was my teleworking day so I was home.  FedEx rings the doorbell at 3pm and drives away.  I pull up my ring app and see the driver carrying the box across my lawn.  By the time I get to the door my 65in tv is leaning against the front door.

I read where the tv looked fine until it was turned on and then there were cracked screens, no issues.  I am totally satisfied with my purchase.

This is a life upgrade and has made our bedroom a new living room in the re-camp of COVID-19, which we need being around one another non-stop for 10 months! We also bought the 4-year protection plan from All-State for $35!!! Can't say enough great things! Cue the confetti cannon!!!!! Best purchase of 2020!!!\", 'I was worried about the TV being damaged during shipping like many other shoppers experienced, but all was well for me. There were two punctures in the box, but no cracks or damage when the TV was powered on.  As for as clarity, it is a great picture for a TV of this price ($348 at the time of purchase). I do have a 65\" Samsung with better color and clarity, but also at a higher price point. I replaced my 55\" TCL Roku TV with this model because I wanted a Tru Motion Display. I don\\'t think any brand has a better user friendly interface than AppleTV or Roku, but LG and Samsung win when it comes to picture quality. I do prefer the LG Smart TV interface over Samsung. But I prefer Samsung\\'s picture quality over LG. I also have an LG soundbar that syncs with my TV so no need to use two remotes or constantly sync the two like with Vizio. Very satisfied with this purchase!', \"The tv is perfect!!! I was scared and doubting about buying it because of the people who said the shipping was awful and they got their tv broken but mine was pretty good. It arrived in three days and the tv works perfectly. And it even has the Apple TV where I can mirror my phone, I love it. If you're afraid of buying,.. Just risk it lol you can always return it.\", 'I love it, the picture is clear and very crisp its like watching a 3 D show.  Plenty of volume.\\nNew TV set ups are not clear for us, but we got it, took About 1 hour to complete. Ours is a 43in tv.  And we have a 50 in also. Same brand. We love them both. Works great', 'OMG I LOVE MY LG 5O\" TV. it arived save.\\nAnd have some wonderful features. The only thing I dont Iike is those duck legs for a stand so I purchased a universal stand for it. I feel way more secure with it.....but that\\'s small matters. \\nAm definitely buying a second one', \"This is the second broken LG TV Walmart has delivered to my house. The first was supposed to be a Christmas surprise and came out of the box with a huge crack in screen. The replacement wasn't obviously damaged, but as soon as you turned it one it's obviously broken. I will never buy electronics for Walmart again\", 'I just received this yesterday.  I bought this item online . I had waited over a week for delivery.  Hung it up today and there is a crack in the right side of the screen when you turn it on naked to the eye when its off. Ugh. I want a refund.. or a new tv. Calling customer service tomorrow after all it is Thanksgiving', \"Thought we would take a chance on the delievery as we had read a few reviews, price was good and TV sounded like a good deal.  Arrived busted now I get to drive 30 minutes to my nearest walmart to return and see what's in stock for collection.  It might have been a good TV but we will never know.\", \"I tried to give the process the benefit of the doubt especially after reading some reviews stating the tv was damaged in shipment.  I can't really rate the quality of the tv because I received a damaged tv as well.  Maybe Walmart would be better off cutting ties with FedEx if the quality of their delivery service is below standards.  If the Walmart trucks can deliver to the stores with no problems then FedEx should be able to do the same especially if delivery is their only business.  All I can say is purchase at your own risk and hope and pray you get better results in the end.  If Tik Tok knows the quality of delivery service FedEx provides maybe it's time for a change Walmart.\", \"Love this tv. The clarity is great. The colors are brilliant. Still trying to figure out all the cool things and settings it has. The only thing I'm having trouble with is the reflection it picks up during the day. Just have to turn it a bit and that takes care of that. I like LG products and have a LG kitchen and laundry room. I trust their products and am glad I got this tv. The price made it even better.\", 'For the price I paid for this TV it is perfect! Definitely worth every penny. The screen resolution is amazing, the sound is strong but not perfect, could be better, even with all those voice options. It is very easy to carry and light weight. The menu option is a bit complicated, could be better. This tv is very smart especially that you get all the advanced smart th options for this price tag and also you can control it with the LG ThinQ app. I got a mount to hang it on the wall.', \"The TV is great. Its the FedEx delivery thats bad. Ordered the TV from Walmart online because its only an online option. First delivery I noticed the box was very damaged. Opened it and the screen was clearly cracked. So I returned it and ordered another one of the same tv. Second delivery box was slightly damaged. I didn't notice it was broken until I had it out of the box.  Needless to say the return process was very easy.\", \"I would give this a 5 star rating but due to delivery I'm deducting 1 star.  I purchased this tv on Nov 30, was given a delivery date of Dec 9.  I was prepared to take off from work to make sure that I was home when it arrived since I've heard so many stories about porch pirates.  To my surprise I receive a text alert from FedEx stating the tv was scheduled for delivery on 12/3.  Don't get me wrong, I do appreciate how quickly the tv arrived after purchase (2 days).  My rating is not on the tv but Walmart.  It just so happened that Thursday was my teleworking day so I was home.  FedEx rings the doorbell at 3pm and drives away.  I pull up my ring app and see the driver carrying the box across my lawn.  By the time I get to the door my 65in tv is leaning against the front door.   What if I wasn't home at that particular time?  Why couldn't Walmart contact me to give me a new delivery date?\\n\\nNow, on to the tv.  I've read a lot of reviews from customers stating that their tv was damaged when it arrived so I was mentally prepared for the disappointment.  Once the tv arrived I brought the box in the house and took pictures of the box, no issues.  I then carefully unboxed the tv and found no issues.  I read where the tv looked fine until it was turned on and then there were cracked screens, no issues.  I am totally satisfied with my purchase.  I'm just bothered by the lack of communication by Walmart not telling me of the earlier delivery date.  I'm left thinking what COULD have happened if I wasn't home.\", 'System is great. Picture is clear. Delivery man (FedEx) stayed on porch until we came to the door. We are super grateful for that! Setup was easy, remote is easy. Love how it automatically switches the HDMI port for whatever system you power on. (DVD player, Video games, etc.) we actually bought the 55 inch but returned it only because we needed a bigger screen.', 'Loving the size and colors of the LG 55\" Class 4K UHDSmart TV. Easy set-up and navigation. Loads of features as you can change the view mode from vivid, movie,  to game to UHD at the push of a button.

It came already preloaded with several online channels. We have been able to hook up our Xbox and switch with ease also.  It's the perfect size for our family.  The quality and durability is amazing.\", \"So I bought this for my 13 yrs old and he can't have enough of enjoying his 40 inch TV with numerous apps that he enjoys and picture shows clear so great choice low price and worth the money.\", 'I\\'m LOVING this TV! It was easy to set up and there were a few glitches, however, it was a matter of programming and one or two \"re-boots\". There is a slight delay from remote to TV - which I did read about in some reviews before purchase - but other than that I\\'m totally happy with this TV! It has a great picture and sound.', 'Very easy to set up. Tutorial guides you thru the setup process effortly! Excellant picture quality. A great TV for the price!', \"I don't normally leave reviews but I just set up this smart tv and I LOVE IT. I was worried about this brand/TV because the price is low compared to other brands - but this is not a reflection of quality, just a reason to pick this TV over others. images are crisp, bright, and 40 in screen was the perfect size for my bedroom\", 'Great tv with a great picture. I was checking out settings & was surprised when I received a message on the screen telling me if I changed to that setting the energy usage would be more. Therefore would cost more annually to operate. I loved that!', 'I’m a trucker I bought this tv for my truck 4 months ago and I love! Just order another for my boyfriend Big Truck for his birthday this month he doesn’t have a smart tv in his.and he loves min so it’s perfect gift for his birthday!', 'I love my new smart TV...colors are sharp and bright...Thank you Walmart', 'Great pic and easy to set up', 'I put 3 star because the remote dose not light up.Every night I have to put my light on to see the buttons. The remote buttons are very small probably to fit all the extra buttons for Amazon ,Redbox ,Hulu and so on. I am constantly turning the TV off when I try to hit the Amazon prime TV button because they are so small and very close together.This remote will not be good for a man.You need to have small hands to press the buttons.Great picture color and the free channels is a nice bonus.If they can make a light up remote and larger buttons it be a five star tv.', 'Purchased in October 2020 first fuzzy pic, I used the menu to try to clear pic, forget it.

The sound is good, but I wanted better. I have a Logitech Z313 audio system with great bass. It uses a 3.5 jack that I usually hook up to the headphone jack, but this TV does not have one, so I tried to use a RCA AV OUTPUT, but this TV only has a AV INPUT! It has a DIGITAL OPTICAL CABLE CONNECTION, that will work great with a sound bar. There is a little hole next to the HDMI cable that is for EXTERNAL AMPLIFIERS, so I put my 3.5mm jack in there and it works great. When this is connected you are unable to use the internal speakers. I have watched 3 4k videos with absolutely no problem at all. It streams videos very well. No buffering or nothing when using KODI!! This is a fantastic deal for 319.99. This is as good as any Black Friday deal you are going to find 4 months from now.  I would recommend this TV to all my friends and family and anyone who ask. The quality of the picture and 4k movies are TOTALLY AWESOME!! BUY IT BEFORE THE PRICE GOES UP!!! As always, buy the 4 year warranty to be on the safe side!! The 52.00 is not a big loss if you don't use it, but if you need it, you will be very happy you have it!!\", 'It was the perfect size for tv stand in the bedroom.', \"I've always loved roku so having a roku tv is amazing. Super easy to use and access all of your apps and shows. My 2 year old knows how to use the remote (probably better than I do). Picture quality is great and the TV itself was very easy to mount on the wall. Took me maybe 15 minutes by myself. The remote is nice and simple to use. 10/10 would recommend a ROKU tv to anyone in the market.\", 'Roku ready and I  can use as a monitor or to watch live tv or cable.', \"I never had this brand of TV and I'm loving it in my room.\", \"This Roku TV is an overall great TV, and well worth the price.The picture quality is crystal-clear if you use streaming, or anything with an HDMI connection. Things like a non-HDMI cable/satellite box, or a VCR will not produce a high quality picture, but they're never expected to, especially on HDTVs.The streaming is smooth and seamless. Videos load within about three seconds, with no buffering or random disconnecting.The speakers are decent, especially for such a thin TV. I only have to adjust the volume ±10 between external devices and streaming. The only noteworthy exception is Netflix; the volume does have to be turned up high in order to hear it well, but about 50-70 will sound loud and clear in my case. I've never had to get it up to 100, and I almost never have to get it beyond 20.The wide variety of connection ports this TV supports will work great with almost every entertainment center, as they support both HD and SD devices, and even a USB flash drive.All in all, this is a quality TV, and a steal for the price. I highly recommend it.\", 'We just got this tv last sunday. I love it more rhen my smart tv in oir bedroom. We picked this one up for the grand kids play room. I will end up getting a soind bar for it. But that is only because it is close to our furnace /ac area. Other then that sound is great. Price was good too. Will be buying two more for xmas gifts. It was easy set up.  Remote is noce and easy to use', \"I now have two of these TVs and I really do think it works very. I had no trouble setting it up by myself except for the fact that the legs on one of the TVs is not fitting correctly. my issue with the TV is the fact that you must buy a Roku soundbar to go with this TV. I bought salad bars to go with this TV at the time of purchase and come to find out that I had to get a Roku Soundbar it could be no other brand. I even had a smaller Soundbar for the bedroom TV but it was and on soundbar not a Roku. the TV itself works well and the speakers you can hear pretty well. I am hard of hearing so I needed the speakers to go with the TV so I didn't blow the TV speakers.\", \"was great for 2 weeks now doesn't turn on at all. loved it the very short time I owned it. turned it off went to the store came back now it won't power on at all.\", 'I WAS SURPRISED BY WHATS IN THE BACK OF MY TV, IT BROKE ACCIDENTALLY AND I TOOK IT APART TO RECYCLE AND LOOK WHAT I SAW.

Maybe because we are not on top of the newest technology or something, we had a difficult time getting it going. We have satellite tv and needed to connect the box which does not support HDMI so we searched U Tube and finally with some hit and miss views we figured it out somehow. Works great, clear, crisp picture and sound works fine for us. Now have to take time to figure the Roku out and secure a better internet service. Almost returned the tv due to all the frustration although walked away from the set up came back with more connection ideas adorned with patience and zap it connected.

I'm having a hard time finding a base that would work since the bottom portion of the TV is not flat. That is really my only issue with it. It is working great so far.\", \"This tv has been a problem since the day I bought it!! Issues connecting to the internet, the words don't sync with whatever we're watching. The remote just stopped working, bought a universal one\", \"For the price you can't really ask for much, let's be honest if you're buying this screen it's because you don't want to spend big bucks. The resolution is 720 which is more than capable of playing any streaming service in great quality, I honestly don't see any lack of resolution. The sound is decent, better than a lot of other Roku TVs for the price range, the volume diminishing return is not as bad as it is with other brands. The only gripe I have is the Vudu button which it's useless to me.\", \"Because of learning Disabilities, I need a TV that is very easy to use.  I had to have help as I have a problem in setting up electronics with a lot of wires and I had TV, Phone, Internet  and a small cable package.  I couldn't do it.
