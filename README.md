# walmart-review-dat
Data analysis from Walmart review data (TV's) scraped from walmart.com

As a group, we collaborated on Jupyter Notebook using Python to create a webscraping tool.
This webscraping tool would scrape walmart.com for customer review data on TVs using the BeautifulSoup library.
After webscraping, we compiled the 200 reviews into a table using Pandas.

The Python script outputs the data into a csv.

After the project, I expanded on it myself using R for some data visualizations.  
I found that generally, more customers are likely to participate on a review with a rating on one side of the scale (rating 5, or rating 1).
This participation could be anything from commenting to leaving a "Helpful Yes" thumbs up.
Longer descriptive titles, or short specific titles addressing a liking or disliking to a product draw more participation.

This analysis can be of use to companies looking to implement an effective review system on product pages to help customers.
